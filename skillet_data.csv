.andrewstorm,"We’ve over doubled DOS2’s five races, bringing 11 to life in BG3 with 31 subraces.
DOS2’s 10 ‘schools of spells’ is eclipsed by the 12 classes & 46 subclasses in BG3.
You caused chaos with the 225 player spells & actions in DOS2, so just imagine the havoc you’re about to unleash upon Faerûn with the over 600 spells & actions, excluding upcasts, in BG3.
Characters in DOS2 enjoyed 45 talents, against BG3’s 308 passive features, which are comparable to talents."
.andrewstorm,"We will be releasing the game in order of platform readiness. Baldur’s Gate 3 will first come to PC on August 3rd, before launching on PlayStation 5 a few weeks later on September 6th."
